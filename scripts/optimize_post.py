        "Based on our classroom experience, students grasp these distinctions faster when teachers model one example aloud before asking learners to work independently.",

        "A common mistake students make is treating all items in this category as interchangeable — to address this, ask them to substitute one for another in a sentence and notice whether the meaning shifts.",
        "One pitfall learners often encounter is skipping the examples and jumping straight to the list — the fix is to require them to write one original sentence per term before moving on.",
        "We have noticed that beginners frequently confuse the more formal variants with their everyday equivalents; the clearest way to address this is through side-by-side sentence comparisons.",
        "Students regularly underestimate how much context shapes meaning here — a practical solution is to present each term in two contrasting sentences so the nuance becomes visible.",

        "We recommend pairing this material with a short writing prompt so students apply the vocabulary immediately rather than passively reading the list.",

        "In our practice, supplementing this content with a simple sorting game (positive / negative / neutral) yields the strongest outcomes for students who are visual learners.",
        "We have found that giving students a personal connection task — asking them to link each word to a memory or a person they know — significantly deepens long-term recall.",

    "curriculum_context": [
        "From a curriculum standpoint, this content aligns well with vocabulary acquisition standards that call for learning words in rich semantic networks rather than in isolation.",

        "Educators following a structured literacy approach will find this material slots naturally into the word study block, particularly at the morphology and semantics stage.",

OUTPUT STRUCTURE — follow this order exactly, every time:
1. # [H1 title — preserve the original title word for word]
2. [Opening paragraph — sapo, 40–60 words, answers the title, defines the key term, names the audience]
3. [Body sections — preserve the exact number and hierarchy of H2/H3 headings from the original; only rewrite heading text when Rule 3 requires it]
4. [Comparison table — only if the post covers multiple categories AND no table exists yet]
5. ## Frequently Asked Questions
   [Exactly 4 Q&A pairs in this format:]
   ### Q: [question derived from the post content]
   [40–80 word self-contained answer]
6. ## References
   [Only include this section if Rule 4 added at least one citation; omit entirely otherwise]

FORMATTING RULES:
- Use clean markdown only: # H1, ## H2, ### H3, - bullet, 1. numbered, | table |
- No HTML comments, no annotation markers, no GEO-EDIT tags, no meta-commentary
- Bold key terms with **double asterisks** where it aids readability

    return f"""You are a GEO editor for Worksheetzone.org. Apply the 10 GEO optimization rules to the blog post below.

CONSISTENCY INSTRUCTION: Follow the OUTPUT STRUCTURE below with strict discipline on every run — same section order, same heading levels, same FAQ format. For narrative prose (sapo, paragraph openers, expertise signals) use natural, varied phrasing rather than repeating fixed templates. Structure must be identical across posts; sentence-level wording must feel human and fresh.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
1. Return ONLY the complete optimized blog post — no annotations, no HTML comments, no explanations.
2. Preserve the author's voice. Make the minimum change needed for each rule. Never rewrite a sentence that already meets the criteria.
3. For Rule 9 (expertise signals), insert these two sentences exactly as written, placed naturally in two separate body sections — do not cluster them together:
   Sentence A: "{phrase_a}"
   Sentence B: "{phrase_b}"
4. For Rule 10 (internal links), you MUST ONLY use URLs from the VERIFIED CANDIDATES below. Do not invent, guess, or modify any URL. Insert fewer links rather than force an unnatural one.

{FORMAT_CONTRACT}

VERIFIED INTERNAL LINK CANDIDATES (use only these for Rule 10):
Each line: type:<intent> score:<relevance> [Title](URL) matched:<keywords>
{links_block}

GEO OPTIMIZATION RULES:
Rule 1 - Sapo: Rewrite the opening paragraph only if needed so it answers the title in sentence 1, contains an explicit "X is..." definition, names the target audience, is 40-60 words, and does not open with meta-commentary. Leave unchanged if it already passes all five.
Rule 2 - Paragraph opening sentences: Rewrite only the first sentence of each body paragraph if it lacks a direct declarative statement, a concrete detail (grade level / time / quantity / named framework), or is not independently meaningful out of context. Leave all other sentences untouched.
Rule 3 - Headings: Leave specific descriptive headings unchanged. Rewrite vague label-style headings (Benefits, Tips, Overview) to be specific. Add an H3 for sections over 300 words that have no subheading.
Rule 4 - In-text citations: For any statistic, research finding, or curriculum standard already in the post, search for the authoritative source and embed a verified markdown link. Append a ## References section. Flag unverifiable claims as [VERIFY: description].
Rule 5 - Definitions: For each key term's first mention lacking a nearby definition, insert one sentence "A [term] is..." under 25 words. Do not touch surrounding text.
Rule 6 - Inline lists to structured lists: Convert sentences packing 3 or more items in running text into bulleted or numbered lists. Keep the lead-in sentence.
Rule 7 - Comparison table: Add a markdown table only if the post covers multiple categories AND no table already exists. Max 3-5 columns.
Rule 8 - FAQ: If no FAQ exists, append exactly 4 Q&A pairs as specified in the OUTPUT STRUCTURE above. If FAQ exists, audit: adjust answers outside 40-80 words; do not replace existing questions.
Rule 9 - Expertise signals: Insert the two sentences provided above (Sentence A and Sentence B) into separate body sections where they fit naturally.
Rule 10 - Internal links: From VERIFIED CANDIDATES above, embed 3-5 links in paragraph/body text only — never inside headings. Apply all of these checks before placing each link:
  a) Intent match: type:tool → anchor must contain "maker/generator/builder/creator"; type:worksheet or type:category → anchor must be "worksheets/printables/resources"; type:blog → anchor must be an informational phrase ("tips/strategies/how to/ideas")
  b) No-Reach Rule: never link a broad anchor to a narrow URL. Invalid: "activities" → /blog/100th-day-of-school-ideas. Valid: "activities" → /worksheets or /blog/ela-activities
  c) Semantic fit: replace the anchor mentally with its definition — if the sentence breaks, reject the link
  d) Context check: 3 words before and after must be instructional (practice/students/use/try/download). Reject if context is conversational (however/also/by the way)
  e) 1% doubt rule: any uncertainty → skip. Accuracy is 100x more important than density
  Hard cap: 5 new links. Never modify or remove existing links.
