# GEO Blog Post Optimizer — Complete Setup & Usage Manual

This tool automatically optimizes blog posts for AI search visibility (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity). It reads a Google Sheet, rewrites each post using Gemini or Claude, creates a formatted Google Doc, and writes the result back to the sheet.

---

## Quick Install (Mac / Linux)

Open Terminal and run this single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abc-elearning-app/agent-factory/project/geo-blog-post-optimizer/install-geo-optimizer.sh | bash
```

The installer guides you through every step interactively — checking prerequisites, downloading the tool, installing dependencies, connecting to Google, and building the link cache. **Estimated time: 5–15 minutes.**

> The only part that cannot be automated is creating your Google Cloud credentials (Step 2 below). The installer will pause and walk you through it when the time comes.

## 1. What You Need Before Starting

Make sure you have all of the following before starting:

| Requirement | How to check |
|-------------|-------------|
| A Mac or Linux computer | — |
| Python 3.9 or newer | Open Terminal, type `python3 --version` |
| Git | Open Terminal, type `git --version` |
| A Google account | — |
| Access to the team Google Sheet | Ask the team lead to share it with you |
| Either Gemini CLI **or** Claude CLI installed | See Step 3 |

> **Windows users:** These instructions assume Mac/Linux. On Windows, use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow the same steps inside a WSL terminal.

---

## 2. Step 1 — Run the Installer

Open **Terminal** and paste this command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abc-elearning-app/agent-factory/project/geo-blog-post-optimizer/install-geo-optimizer.sh | bash
```

The installer runs 7 steps automatically:

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Checks Python 3.9+, Git, pip3 — prints install hints if anything is missing |
| 2 | Asks where to install (press Enter to use the default: `~/geo-optimizer`) |
| 3 | Downloads the tool from GitHub |
| 4 | Installs all Python packages |
| 5 | **Pauses here** — guides you to create Google Cloud credentials (see Step 2 below) |
| 6 | Opens a browser to connect your Google account |
| 7 | Builds the internal link cache (~24,000 URLs) |

When it finishes, it prints exactly which commands to run next.

> **Re-running the installer is safe.** It updates the code and skips steps already completed (existing credentials, existing cache).

---

## 3. Step 2 — Set Up Google Cloud (one-time)

This is the most involved step. You need to create your own Google Cloud project and OAuth credentials. This is free and takes about 10 minutes.

**The installer will pause and wait for you at this step.** Follow the instructions below, then return to the Terminal and press Enter.

### 3a. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.
2. At the top of the page, click the project dropdown (it may say "Select a project").
3. Click **New Project**.
4. Give it any name (e.g. `geo-optimizer`) and click **Create**.
5. Make sure your new project is selected in the dropdown before continuing.

### 3b. Enable Required APIs

You need to enable three APIs. For each one:

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services → Library**.
2. Search for the API name, click it, then click **Enable**.

Enable these three APIs:
- **Google Sheets API**
- **Google Docs API**
- **Google Drive API**

### 3c. Create OAuth Credentials

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
2. Click **+ Create Credentials** → **OAuth client ID**.
3. If prompted to configure the OAuth consent screen first:
   - Click **Configure Consent Screen**
   - Choose **External** → click **Create**
   - Fill in **App name** (any name, e.g. "GEO Optimizer"), **User support email** (your email), **Developer contact** (your email)
   - Click **Save and Continue** through all steps until done
   - Go back to **Credentials → + Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**
4. For **Application type**, choose **Desktop app**.
5. Give it any name and click **Create**.
6. A dialog will appear — click **Download JSON**.
7. Rename the downloaded file to `client_secret.json`.
8. Move it into the install folder (default: `~/geo-optimizer/`).

Once the file is in place, return to the Terminal and press **Enter** — the installer will continue automatically.

## 4. Step 3 — Set Up Your AI Writer

The tool supports two AI writers: **Gemini** (free, uses your Google account) and **Claude** (requires Anthropic subscription). You only need one.

### Option A: Gemini CLI (recommended — free)

1. Install Gemini CLI: [https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
2. Run `gemini --version` in Terminal to confirm it works.
3. Run `gemini` once and sign in with your Google account when prompted.

### Option B: Claude CLI

1. Install Claude Code: [https://claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
2. Sign in with your Anthropic account.
3. Run `claude --version` in Terminal to confirm it works.

> **Which writer to use?** Check the **Writer** column in the Google Sheet — it will say either `Gemini` or `Claude`. Set up whichever is assigned to your rows.

---

## 5. Step 4 — Get Access to the Google Sheet

Ask the team lead to:
- Share the **Google Sheet** with your Google account (Editor access)
- Share the **"GEO Optimized Posts"** Google Drive folder with your account

Use the same Google account you authenticated with in the installer.

---

## 6. Running the Optimizer

Once setup is complete, go to your install folder and run:

```bash
cd ~/geo-optimizer
```

### Basic usage

```bash
# Process the next 10 rows (default)
python3 scripts/run_batch.py
```

### Process a specific number of rows

```bash
python3 scripts/run_batch.py --limit 50
```

### Process a specific range of rows

```bash
# Only process rows 72 to 150 in the sheet
python3 scripts/run_batch.py --start-row 72 --end-row 150
```

### Test run without writing anything

```bash
# Optimizes posts but does NOT create Docs or update the sheet
python3 scripts/run_batch.py --limit 3 --dry-run
```

> **Recommended pace:** Process 50–80 rows per week to avoid triggering Google's spam filters.

### What you'll see while it runs

```

---

## 7. Understanding the Results

After the tool runs, open the Google Sheet. Each processed row will be updated:

| Column | What it shows |
|--------|--------------|
| **Status** | `Done ✅` if successful, `Failed ❌` if something went wrong |
| **Optimized Doc** | Link to the Google Doc with the optimized post |
| **Fail Reason** | If status is `Failed ❌`, this explains what went wrong |
| **Processed Date** | The date the row was processed |

### What the optimized post contains

Each optimized post is a ready-to-copy Google Doc with:
- Original title preserved exactly
- Rewritten opening paragraph (sapo) — 40–60 words
- All headings improved to be specific and descriptive
- Definitions for key terms
- Bullet/numbered lists where appropriate
- A comparison table (if the post covers multiple categories)
- Exactly 4 FAQ pairs at the end
- 3–4 verified internal links to worksheetzone.org pages
- Proper heading styles (H1/H2/H3) and table borders — ready to paste into WordPress

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Error message | Cause | Fix |
|---------------|-------|-----|
| `oauth_token.pickle not found` | Authentication not completed | Re-run the installer |
| `Token expired` | OAuth token older than ~1 week | See "Refreshing credentials" below |
| `No client_secret*.json found` | Credentials file missing or misnamed | Re-download from Google Cloud Console, rename to `client_secret.json`, place in install folder |
| `Gemini error` | Gemini CLI not logged in | Run `gemini` in Terminal and sign in |
| `Claude error` | Claude CLI not authenticated | Run `claude` in Terminal and sign in |
| `Fetch failed` | Blog post URL blocked or offline | Row is skipped automatically; check the URL manually |
| `wzorg_link_cache.json not found` | Cache not built | Run: `python3 scripts/build_sitemap_cache.py` |
| `Doc creator failed` | Docs/Drive API issue | Check [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) — all three APIs must be enabled |
| `403 The caller does not have permission` | Drive folder not shared with your account | Ask team lead to share "GEO Optimized Posts" folder with your Google account |

### Refreshing expired credentials

OAuth tokens expire after about a week. If you see a `Token expired` error, re-run the installer — it will detect the expired token and re-authenticate:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abc-elearning-app/agent-factory/project/geo-blog-post-optimizer/install-geo-optimizer.sh | bash
```

Or delete `oauth_token.pickle` from the install folder and re-run the installer.

### Rebuilding the link cache

Run this whenever new content is published on worksheetzone.org:

```bash
cd ~/geo-optimizer
python3 scripts/build_sitemap_cache.py
```
